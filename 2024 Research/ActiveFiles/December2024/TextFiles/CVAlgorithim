Pseudo Code for determining lambda at a SINGLE datapoint
Perform LOOCV
For each lambda in a sequence (determined via glmnet's recommendation or some other way)
  For each datapoint in the window
      -fit model with all data except specific datapoint
      -Calculate squared error of all datapoints WEIGHTED BASED ON KERNEL
  Take average of results to get our CV estimate
Use the lambda that generated the lowest CV estiamte
